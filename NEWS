CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1

NEW METHOD TO ASSESS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GREX PREDICTION

    o ANOVA p-value < 0.05 is not used anymore; instead:
    
    o During the training phase a k-fold cross-validation on the training
      dataset now performed; k can be defined by the user or be the default (5)
    
    o R-squared (R^2) between predicted GReX and real expression values are
      computed
    
    o GReX of genes for which the mean of the R^2 is above 0.01 are considered
      non-randomly predicted, according to the new benchmarking standards [ref]
