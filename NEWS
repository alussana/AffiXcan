CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------

UPDATED DOCUMENTATION

    o Formatting of functions documentation has been improved

    o Important: vignette is still outdated (AffiXcan 1.2.0)


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
------------------------

POPULATION STRUCTURE COVARIATES ARE OPTIONAL

    o Providing population structure covariates is now not mandatory to perform
      models training

    o An ANOVA p-value will be computed for each gene for which a model could
      be trained, only if the covariates were provided


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1
------------------------

K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION IS SUPPORTED

    o ANOVA p-value < 0.05 to assess prediction significance is not used
      anymore; instead:
    
    o A k-fold cross-validation on the training dataset may be performed;
      k can be defined by the user
    
    o Pearson correlation coefficients (R) and determination coefficients (R^2)
      between predicted GReX and real expression values of genes are computed
    
    o In literature, GReX of genes for which the mean of the R^2 is above 0.01
      are considered non-randomly predicted, according to the new benchmarking
      standards [ref] 


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.3
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug in generating the vignette for 'devel' version of Bioconductor
